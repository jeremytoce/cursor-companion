# Feature Requirements: Installation Directory Migration

## Overview

Move the installation directory from cursor-companion to .cursor/rules while maintaining workflow functionality and ensuring a smooth transition for existing users.

## Goals

- Relocate installation from cursor-companion/ to .cursor/rules/
- Maintain workflows directory structure in new location
- Remove cursor-companion directory after successful migration
- Support both paths during transition period for backward compatibility

## Functional Requirements

### Migration Process

1. Create new directory structure in .cursor/rules/
2. Copy existing workflows and configurations to new location
3. Update all file path references in code
4. Implement transition period support for both old and new paths
5. Remove cursor-companion directory after successful migration

### Path Updates

1. Update all file path references in:
   - Workflow pack files
   - Configuration files
   - Documentation
   - Installation scripts

### Backward Compatibility

1. Implement path checking logic to support both:
   - .cursor/rules/ (new path)
   - cursor-companion/ (legacy path)
2. Add deprecation warnings for old path usage
3. Document migration path for existing users

## Technical Requirements

### Directory Structure

\`.cursor/rules/
├── workflows/
├── features/
└── [other existing directories]\`

### Migration Safety

1. Verify successful file copying before removal
2. Implement rollback capability if migration fails
3. Preserve file permissions and attributes during migration

### Documentation Updates

1. Update all path references in documentation
2. Add migration guide for existing users
3. Update installation instructions for new users

## Success Criteria

1. All workflows function correctly from new location
2. Existing installations continue to work during transition
3. No loss of functionality or user data during migration
4. Clear migration path documented for users

## Timeline

1. Implementation Phase
   - Directory structure setup
   - Path updates in codebase
   - Backward compatibility implementation
2. Testing Phase
   - Migration testing
   - Workflow functionality verification
3. Documentation Phase
   - Update all documentation
   - Create migration guides
4. Release Phase
   - Gradual rollout
   - Monitor for issues

## Risks and Mitigation

1. Risk: Data loss during migration
   - Mitigation: Implement backup before migration
2. Risk: Breaking changes for existing users
   - Mitigation: Support both paths during transition
3. Risk: Incomplete path updates
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive testing and validation
